                <h2>First woman of Indian origin to go to space</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Kalpana Chawla</b> was an Indian-born American astronaut and mechanical engineer who was the first woman of Indian
                    origin to go to space.After getting a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering 
                    College, India, she moved to the United States in 1982 and obtained a Master of Science degree in Aerospace 
                    Engineering from the University of Texas at Arlington in 1984.Chawla went on to earn a second Masters in 1986 and
                    a PhD in aerospace engineering in 1988 from the University of Colorado Boulder.In 1988, Chawla began working at 
                    NASA Ames Research Center, where she did computational fluid dynamics (CFD) research on vertical and/or short 
                    take-off and landing (V/STOL) concepts.She first flew on Space Shuttle Columbia in 1997 as a mission specialist 
                    and primary robotic arm operator.In 2000, Chawla was selected for her second flight as part of the crew of STS-107.
                    Chawla died on 1 February 2003, in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, along with the other six crew members, when
                    Columbia disintegrated over Texas during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, shortly before it was scheduled to 
                    conclude its 28th mission, STS-107.Her remains were identified along with those of the rest of the crew members and
                    were cremated and scattered at Zion National Park in Utah in accordance with her wishes.
